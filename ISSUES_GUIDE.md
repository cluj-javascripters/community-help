# Issues Guide

We love helping others and we love a good challenge that will help us grow as well.
That's why we created this repo. To be the "go-to and ask for help" side of our community.

However, it's important to you and us as well to try to minimize the time spent on analyzing issues.
This guide lays down a couple of points that we would like you to read before proceeding with asking for help.

### Rules for opening a new issue

__1. Be specific__

As much as we would like to help you with anything, we will not be able to. We too have limited time at our
disposal, so being specific in your request helps a lot. Unfortunately, we will not consider issues such as: __"I need help with my project!"__ or
__"Please help me asap!"__. We hope you understand we cannot analyze a big context so please take your
time and try to isolate on your own the problem that you have.

__2. Help us by providing code samples__

It's very important to to us to form a mental picture as soon as possible. So please provide us
with some code examples, explaining what you are trying to do, how the codebase currently looks,
what errors do you get, etc. For this you can use [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) or [plunker](https://plnkr.co/)
or whatever you want. We acknowledge this is an extra effort from your side, but it's well worth
it if you want to maximize our chances of helping you.

__3. Focus on written communication__

As much as we'd love to help you by jumping in a Skype/Hangouts/w/e call with you, the truth
is, we won't be able to. So try to focus on written communication (detail your problem, provide
context, let us know how we can get back to you, etc.)

__4 .If you solved it, let us know__

There's nothing better than you figuring out solutions on your own. If this happens, then congratulations!
You've just increased your skills and became a better professional! In this situation, we kindly ask
you to take some time and post your solution on the issue you opened and then close it, so that we can
focus only on those that are still alive and haven't been solved yet. Remember that, by doing this,
you will help us as well as the community (someone else may have similar problems and find your
answer helpful).

__5. We don't know everything__

The JS landscape is incredibly vast. Although we try our best to keep up to date with everything, the
truth is there are a lot of things we don't know either (from JS frameworks to plugins in the ecosystem). So sometimes, we will not be able to help you right away.
In those cases, we would appreciate that you understand this and try to make the process a collaborative one
(we learn together and dissect the problem). Focusing on a productive communication will be the
key to getting to a solution as fast as possible.

__6. We answer when we can__

Our focus is on helping you. And we try our best at this. But we do have other responsibilities
during the day (coding, meetings at work, long calls with clients, etc.). We always try to get back
to you as soon as possible, but we ask that you understand there is no timeframe for this and that, sometimes,
other things will take priority. Please be patient, don't spam the issue thread, don't get
angry/violent in communication and most importantly, don't give up on finding the answer on your own.
There's nothing more valuable than you putting effort into undersanding and solving the problem by yourself.
And if this happens, remember __point 4__ :P.
