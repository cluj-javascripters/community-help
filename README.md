# community-help

## Motivation
We have all been beginners once. At often times we spent hours searching for solutions to our various technicall problems, bugs or architecture questions. The more one codes, the more one understands such pains.

Sharing knowledge is one of the core values of our community. We consider that providing help is an opportunity to share knowledge and to learn together. Therefore we decided to move help requests on GitHub in order to easily track their status.

We find that helping others is fun! So go on, challenge us! The Cluj JavaScripters community will help you (and will enjoy doing it... ;) ). To get started you just need to [create an issue](https://github.com/cluj-javascripters/community-help/issues/new).

But please make sure you read the [guide](https://github.com/cluj-javascripters/community-help/ISSUES_GUIDE.md) before that. It clearly explains how to ask for help so that we can understand your problem and come up with a solution as fast as possible.
